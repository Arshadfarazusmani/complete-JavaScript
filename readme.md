 # JAVASCRIPT 
## Defination :
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) .


HTML : is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.

CSS : is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.

JAVASCRIPT : is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much more . 

### More exciting !!

What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.

## API(Application Programming Interface):

APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.

They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.

Generally two catogories -> 3rd party API and Browser API .

## Browser API 

Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things. For example:

The DOM (Document Object Model) API allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some new content displayed.

The Geolocation API retrieves geographical information. This is how Google Maps is able to find your location and plot it on a map.

The Canvas and WebGL APIs allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics.

Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia, such as play audio and video right in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone else's computer.

## Third party API

Third party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example:

The Twitter API allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.

The Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap API allows you to embed custom maps into your website, and other such functionality.
