# Conditionals
some time we need to run the code on the basis of some conditions , for that we use conditional statements .
        -> if,if-else,if else-if else 
if:-> run code one the given condition 

```js
//syntex ->
if(condition){
    // code -> code will only run if the condition is true 
}
```
### code 
```js
if(true){
    console.log("you are in if block")
}
```
